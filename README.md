ROROID_smart_doorbell
=====================
Sometimes I get frustrated that the guy from the delivery company or postman comes to my door and is too lazy to make a call telling me that I receive a package. Many times I’m the lazy one when some friends come to my house and I need to go outside in the rain to open the door for them. Considering all this I develop a project to kill laziness :-). Just kidding.

I build a smart doorbell. When you press the doorbell button it rings like a normal doorbell. The same happens the second and third time. But if no answer happens till now, at the fourth time the button is pressed, the doorbell will call you on your mobile phone number allowing you to speak with the person that is at your door. Also with the help of DTMF codes it’s allowing you to open the door from anywhere you might be in that moment.
